Of course. Let's take a deep and detailed dive into exactly how your **TimeCapsule.AI** project works, from the moment a user opens the page to the second their data is securely saved.

You have successfully built a **full-stack web application**. This means you've created three distinct, interconnected layers: the Frontend, the Backend, and the Database.

---
## üé® The Frontend (The "Face" of the App)

This is everything the user sees and interacts with in their web browser. It's the "storefront" of your application, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Its main job is to look good, collect user input, and talk to the backend.

### Authentication & Security üö™
The first thing your application does is figure out who the user is.
1.  **The Bouncer (`auth.js`):** When you try to visit `index.html` or any protected page, the `<script src="auth.js">` at the top runs *immediately*. It checks the browser's `localStorage` for a "login token." If no token is found, it acts like a bouncer and instantly redirects the user to `login.html`. They can't get in without a ticket.
2.  **Getting the Ticket (`login.html` & `signup.html`):**
    * On the **signup page**, the user enters their details. The JavaScript sends this information to the `/signup` endpoint on your backend.
    * On the **login page**, the script sends the email and password to the `/login` endpoint. If the backend confirms the credentials are correct, it sends back a special, encrypted string of text called a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
3.  **Saving the Ticket:** The browser receives this JWT and saves it in `localStorage`. This token is now the user's proof of identity for the rest of their session.

### Making API Requests üì®
Once logged in, the frontend's main job is to send and receive data from the backend.
* **Sending a New Capsule:** When you fill out the "Add Capsule" form and click "Save," your JavaScript code does several things:
    1.  It creates a `FormData` object, which is like a digital envelope that can hold both text and files.
    2.  It bundles up all your text input (capsule name, description, etc.).
    3.  It attaches the photo and video files you selected. üñºÔ∏è
    4.  Crucially, it retrieves the saved **JWT** from `localStorage` and adds it to the request's `Authorization` header. This is like attaching your ID card to the envelope.
    5.  Finally, it sends this entire package to the `/capsule` endpoint on your backend using the `fetch` command.
* **Requesting Existing Capsules:** When you visit the "Review Capsules" page, the JavaScript sends a `fetch` request to the `/capsules` endpoint. It also attaches your JWT to prove who is asking for the data.

### Dynamic Content & Visuals ‚ú®
The frontend isn't just static pages; it's a dynamic experience.
* **Rendering Data:** On the `review.html` page, the script waits for the backend to respond with a list of capsules. It then loops through this data and *dynamically* builds the HTML for each capsule card, displaying locked capsules with a countdown and unlocked ones with a clickable "cover" image.
* **Animations:** You've used two powerful libraries to make the site feel alive:
    * **Three.js:** This is a 3D graphics library that you're using to draw the immersive, animated "Cybergrid" background with a custom WebGL shader.
    * **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** This is a professional animation library that powers the smooth, interactive "Liquid Glass" cursor effect.

## üß† The Backend (The "Brain" of the App)

This is the powerful engine running on a server (like Render) that the user never sees. You built it with **Node.js** and the **Express** framework. Its main job is to handle requests, enforce rules, and manage data.

### The Central Hub
Your `index.js` file acts as the central hub.
* **Web Server:** `app.use(express.static('.'))` turns your server into a file host, allowing it to send your HTML, CSS, and image files to the browser. `app.use('/uploads', ...)` makes your uploaded photos and videos accessible.
* **API Server:** The server listens for specific API requests at defined routes (e.g., `/login`, `/capsules`).

### Authentication & Security Logic üõ°Ô∏è
The backend is responsible for all security.
* **Password Hashing (`bcryptjs`):** When a user signs up, the backend never stores their password directly. It uses `bcryptjs` to scramble the password into a long, irreversible "hash." When they log in, it hashes the password they just typed and compares it to the hash in the database. This is a critical security practice.
* **Token Verification (JWT):** For any protected route, the `authenticateToken` middleware runs first. It's the server's security guard. It checks the `Authorization` header for a JWT. If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, it immediately rejects the request with a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` error. If the token is valid, it decodes it to find out which user is making the request and attaches their information to the request object ( `req.user` ).

### Data Processing & File Handling ‚öôÔ∏è
* **`multer`:** When a request to create a new capsule comes in, the `multer` middleware steps in first. It's a specialist that knows how to handle file uploads. It takes the photo and video files out of the request, saves them to your `uploads/` folder with unique names, and then attaches the file information (like the path, e.g., `uploads/photos-12345.png`) to the request object for the main route handler to use.
* **Route Handlers:** After the middleware is done, the main route logic runs. For example, when creating a capsule, it takes the text data from `req.body` and the file paths from `multer`, gets the `user_id` from the decoded token, and organizes it all for the database.



---
## üíæ The Database (The "Memory" of the App)

This is your application's permanent memory, where all the important information is stored. You're using **PostgreSQL**.

### The Schema (The "Blueprint")
You created a blueprint for your data with two tables: `users` and `capsules`.
* **`users` Table:** This is a simple list of all your users, containing their unique `id`, `name`, `email`, and the securely hashed `password_hash`.
* **`capsules` Table:** This stores all the capsule data: `capsule_name`, `text`, `template`, `unlock_date`, and the file paths for the `photo_path` and `video_path`.

### The Relational Magic (The Key to Privacy) üîó
The most important piece of your database design is the **foreign key**. The `capsules` table has a `user_id` column that is directly linked to the `id` column in the `users` table (`REFERENCES users(id)`).

* **What this does:** It creates a strict, unbreakable rule: **every capsule *must* belong to a user.**
* **Why it's crucial:** When the backend fetches capsules, the SQL query is `SELECT * FROM capsules WHERE user_id = $1`. The `$1` is the user ID that was securely taken from the JWT. This guarantees that a user can *only* ever retrieve capsules that are directly linked to their own ID. It's physically impossible for the database to return someone else's capsules. This is the foundation of your app's privacy.

By putting all these pieces together, you've created a complete, secure, and dynamic system. Great work!
